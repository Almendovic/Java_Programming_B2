IQ: What is the difference between final, finally, finalize()?

    They are all part of this concepts

    final: not changing the components
        you can't change the value of a final variable
        you can't change the implementation of a final method
        you can't inherit a final class

    finally: block of code used with the try catch. It always runs no matter if there is an exception or not
        -> commonly used for 'clean up' -> ex: closing a connection to a db, or close the Scanner

    finalize(): method that is use with garbage collection. You could define some code that you wanted to run when an object cleaned up.

        int [] a = {3, 4, 1}; // after this line, the object loses its reference
        a = null;
        a = new int[4];

        Garbage collection: cleans up the memory. Removes object with no reference
