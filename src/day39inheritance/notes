Inheritance

    allows us to pass information/inherit from one class to another

    + gives us code re-usability and code maintainability

    + good organization, allow us to set up ideas, connect classes with similar ideas

How to inherit in java

    use extends keyword in the class declaration

    syntax: Child extends Parent

        -> Parent class passes information to the Child class

    ex:

        public class Planet{
            int distanceFromTheSun;
        }

        public class Earth extends Planet{

        }

Relationship between classes
    use 'is a' relation to describe how classes are connected

        child is a parent

        Ex: Earth is a Planet

Describe classes in inheritance

    parent == super == base

    child == sub == derived

What is inherited:

    all public variables & methods
    all protected variables & methods
    default variables & method that are IN THE SAME PACKAGE

What is not inherited:

    all private variables & methods
    default variables & methods that are NOT IN THE SAME PACKAGE
    constructors

How many parents can we have

    in java you can only only one direct parent

    java does not allow multi-inheritance (multiple parents at the same)

    ex: you cannot do this:

        class A extends B, C

    access
        a
        b

protected:

    without inheritance: acts like default, accessible only in the same package

    with inheritance: protected variables & methods can be inherited to sub classes anywhere
