        System.out.println("age");//This prints the character "age" not the variable that has number value
        System.out.println("20");//printing the character 2 adn 0
        System.out.println(20);// by default is 20 an "int" type, will matter in code perspective ,how you can use them,and this is just a number in the code
        System.out.println(age +8 );// age value is 10, then its adds 10+1 and prints 11

        // num =200; 200 is too big for byte types
        short num= 200;// declared and assigned at the same time
