Inheritance

    allows a class to pass its information to a different class

    allows us to avoid repetition of code, write more organized code

What is inherited:

    all public variables & methods
    all protected variables & methods
    any default variables & methods in the same package

What is not inherited:

    constructor
    all private variables & methods
    any default variables & methods outside the package

What is a relation

    a way to describe how two classes in related

    child is a parent

Can you have multiple parent in java

    no, can only have one direct parent

All classes are sub classes of Object class

Constructor with inheritance

    constructor is not inherited

    in order to create object we need to call the parent constructor always

        using super()
