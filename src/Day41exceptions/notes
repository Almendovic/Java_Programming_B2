Exceptions

What is an error

    stops the execution, but it caused by factors outside of the side
    so, we don't handle them

What is an exception

    stops the normal flow of execution because of some code
    we will handle these

Inheritance of Exceptions

    Throwable

        Exception -> checked exceptions

            RuntimeException -> unchecked exceptions

Exceptions are objects

Types of exceptions:

    checked/ compile time

        these exceptions MUST be handled for the program to compile

        Ex: Thread.sleep()
            Note: this method accepts the millisecond argument to pause the execution for that time

    unchecked/ run time

        an exception that could occur and when it does it happens during execution.
        You can handle or fix the code

        Ex: StringIndexOutOfBounds, NullPointerException

How to handle exceptions

    try/catch block

    you are able to run code in the try block
    and then we are able to define possible exceptions that could happen in the catch block
        -> if the exception occurs the catch block will handle it by running whatever code was defined in the catch block

        catch block:
            when we set up a catch block we are defining the type of exception that will be thrown so we create a reference of that object using

            (exception name)

                Note: 'e' is commonly used as the name
                this part acts like a parameter for that block

            Ex: catch(NullPointerException e)
